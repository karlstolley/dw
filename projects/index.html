        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          Single-page sites have seen a resurgent interest in recent years, particularly for
          showcasing products, services, or an entire company. See <a
          href="https://onepagelove.com/">One Page Love</a> for a gallery of examples. This project
          requires you to engage in well-crafted, mobile-first responsive web design with careful,
          bandwidth-friendly treatment of rich media elements as well as responsive images for
          traditional and high-DPI/“retina” screens. You will use the site to tell the story of a
          particular company, product, or organization, and implement elements of your onboarding
          project (Project One). Alternatively, you may use this project to build a one-page site for
          that tells your own professional story, perhaps a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages">GitHub user page</a>
          at &lt;username&gt;.github.io.
        </p>
        <p>
          By engaging in storytelling, you should think both about how the text content of a site
          tells a story, but also how image, audio, and video also helps to tell a story. As we will
          see in the remaining projects in class, good HCI is also good story-telling. It’s a story
          that users/readers can insert themselves into. This project invites you to get even stronger
          in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, while also thinking about techniques and
          strategies to get a specific group of people to want to read all the way through a page.
