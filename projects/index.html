      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          This project asks you to create some kind of digital story about how you became literate
          in using digital communication technologies. Included in the story somehow should be a
          second story of your experience teaching yourself the rudiments of some new digital
          communication practice that you will use to create and share your project. While the
          primary media you will write in should be text, you may enhance that with any other type
          of media you choose (image, audio, video).
        </p>
        <p>
          You will first send a proposal email to the instructor with the new digital communication
          technology you intend to learn for creating your project, along with a rough idea of how
          you will construct your story. Keep in mind that common word processors (Word, Mac Pages,
          Google Docs) are not allowed in this class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, as you draft your narrative, you will turn in two in-progress drafts; the drafts
          should be shared as Dropbox share links that post to Basecamp. Those are due on
          September 7 and September 14 (both Wednesdays). If you opt to learn something that is
          Web-available, you can send the link to the project wherever it's hosted, rather than a
          Dropbox share link.

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
           During the months of September and October and into early November, you will blog or
           privately journal weekly about your activities on a primary social networking service
           (e.g., through social media like Twitter, social reading sites like Reddit).
           Additionally, you will join a new-to-you community or service and begin to establish a
           presence there as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary deliverable for this project is your blog/journal. You may write about
          anything you like regarding your digital presence: for example, the different rhetorical
          identities you notice yourself projecting on, say, Facebook versus Yik Yak; or perhaps a
          major local, national, or world news event and how it unfolds on Twitter. As we begin
          reading articles and book chapters about digital being &amp; presence, you should
          compare your own experiences to the predictions, observations, and arguments in the
          materials we read for class.

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, you will work in small teams to develop your own abilities to write and
          collaborate digitally on a project that teaches IIT faculty members how to assign and
          support students pursuing alternatives to "the paper" for course projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, you will create an oral presentation for a faculty audience in which you
          pitch an electronic assignment in lieu of a traditional paper. Given that your audience is
          IIT faculty, your assignment should be workable across different kinds of classes (and
          your presentation and handout should suggest possible alternatives/modifications
          accordingly).

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will be assigned a random Tuesday over the course of the semester to present a 10- to
          15-track Spotify playlist. The tracks in your playlist should be both autobiographical
          somehow in that each track says something about you, but should also be connected to the
          course materials that week in some way. For each track, you will offer a max 140-character
          story explaining why you included the track in your playlist. Your entire story should
          include a visual design and visual elements (images, silent video) of some kind.
