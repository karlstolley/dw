      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        <b>From the Catalog</b>: This course will cover the creation of Web pages and sites using

        <h4>Required Books</h4>
        <p>
          My policy for assigning books: they are all required in the edition indicated; the total
          retail pricetag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $84 on the
          high end, assuming you opt for the electronic editions); and each book should be worthy
          of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the class has
          ended. My aim is to help you build your professional library.

    <section id="assignments">
      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All assignments for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
        karl.stolley@gmail.com. Submissions should <b>not</b> include email attachments, but
        rather URLs pointing to your project’s Git repository or, for certain assignments as
        indicated, Dropbox Share URLs. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
        in each project description. Weekly work is due before the start of the first class
        meeting each week.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Your active participation in class and in online discussions and chats is required both
        for your own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not
        give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to be prepared
        to discuss that reading, especially on Basecamp.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
        essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
        technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
        acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
        it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage
        all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I
        prefer that you contact me via email or GChat well in advance of assignment and project
        deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
        up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
        is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
        important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
        before a project is due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that
        GitHub accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy
        you are certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b>
        At the same time, you might want to think about how establishing GitHub and other
        accounts under your own name, in cases where you conduct yourself professionally, might
        actually be an asset to your online presence, and the results that future schools or
        employers turn up when they search for you on Google and elsewhere.

    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
        a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
        Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
        violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
      </p>

    <section id="special-needs">
      <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
        order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
        Center for Disability Resources. The <a href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for
        Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the
        first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135,
        or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
      </p>
      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
