     A new spring 2015 course to be offered by

    <h3>Is there anything less inspiring than the wasteland of a blank Word document?</h3>

    <p>
       Do what you need to fill up that expanse &amp; meet the requirements of some forgettable
       assignment. Maybe bump your font size up to 13 points, and manually set the line-spacing to
       be a little more than double at 27 or 28 points. Odds are, nobody will notice. Or even care,
       beyond waiting for a grade to be listed in Blackboard. (And don’t even get me started on
       Blackboard.)
    </p>

    <p class="callout">
      There have never been so many amazing software tools to communicate, so many platforms and
      devices to reach people.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sad fact is, when it’s time to write, people automatically open up Word, or maybe Google
      Docs: it’s basically the same thing. And it basically sucks. It sucks the way Blackboard
      sucks: a technology comes to seem so inevitable, people stop trying to imagine an alternative.
    </p>

    <p class="callout">
      We don’t have to work hard to imagine alternative technologies for writing. The hard work is
      in figuring out alternative approaches to writing and communicating with them in situations
      where they’re not taken seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m willing to bet that the writing tools you love most and use most
      to write the things that really matter to you don’t default to black Times New Roman on a
      white faux 8.5 x 11 page. That’s the same basic format delivered by a typewriter, and
      typewriters were invented in the nineteenth century. And yet you, as a student at a
      technological university in the twenty-first century, have more than a few assignments due
      right now that are going to be prepared in exactly that way.
    </p>

    <p class="callout">
      Most people carry a phone that can do infinitely more to communicate an idea, reach distant
      audiences, and share experiences than a paper or a report ever could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing shouldn’t suck. Writing actually <i>doesn’t</i> suck—but the engrained approaches and
      technologies that professors and bosses and students alike blindly employ very often <i>do</i>
      suck. I totally get why signing up for a class with “writing” in its title sounds like bad
      idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Digital Writing course will acknoweldge a simple, overlooked fact: Humans are noisy,
      social creatures. We speak, we write. We draw and doodle and photograph. Under the best
      circumstances, we’re free to speak and write and communicate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compare the experience writing for classes to all of the other writing you do (and you do do a
      ton of writing outside of class—way more writing that you do inside class): Facebook comments,
      Instagram photos, Snapchats, Kik and WhatsApp and text messages. Tweets. Reblogs on Tumblr.
      Image macros. Rage comics. Snarky YouTube comments. Maybe Vine videos. (Yes, that’s all
      writing).
    </p>

    <p class="callout">
      On our own time and terms, nobody has to threaten us to write, and yet nobody has to reward
      us, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one sits around watching a deadline draw closer and closer while struggling to meet a
      page-length requirement on Medium or Twitter or WordPress or Vine. You type some text or shoot
      a video and go. With urgency. With purpose. Sometimes, as speedy as they are, it’s like the
      apps on your phone or tablet can’t open quickly enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tools are amazing. They work on your phone. They don’t require an expensive monthly
      subscription, like Microsoft or Adobe products do (or will, once you graduate). But it’s not
      just about the tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Digital writing moves away from uninspired paper-based formats like .docx and .pdf, things
      that are basically meant to be filed away and never looked at again, and towards formats that
      emerge not from software engineers alone, but from communities and networks that might
      actually provide an opportunity for your thoughts to interest an audience.
    </p>

    <p class="callout">
      You will never hear someone say, “You know, what I really want
      to do is curl up with my iPad and go find some Word documents to read...”
    </p>

    <p>
      In the formats that most interest and engage people, words compete for equal time with still
      and moving images, sounds, even animation. A phone is as viable of a writing instrument as a
      laptop or a workstation. Instead of letter grades and red-pen marks with useless comments like
      “Awk,” digital writers antipate notifications. It sounds silly, but it’s true. Likes. Reblogs,
      retweets. If we’re lucky, we might even start a conversation. That leads us to write even
      more. Longer. More thoughtfully. There is the possibility for real impact in the world, both
      positive—and certainly negative (we’ll get to that in this class as well).
    </p>

    <h4>The guiding questions in COM201: Digital Writing are:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
      How do we take power and experience of writing digitally, for real audiences, and think
      carefully about it and artfully practice it to reshape how students approach writing for their
      college experience and their careers beyond? and
      </li>
      <li>
      2) What does it look like to genuinely write together, to collaboratively and innovatively
      manage projects and get real work done—not through some lifeless document that nobody’s ever
      going to read, or through towering management structures and marching orders, but through
      ethical, thoughtful uses of tools and approaches that too many people (professors, bosses, and
      even students themselves) think of as just toys and entertainment?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you’ve read this far, you might be interested in some of the projects for the course (not a single one of which is intended to be completed in a word processor):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Digital Literacy Narrative</b> A personal digital essay about the student's development
        as a writer in digital environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Social Media Presence</b> Initiation and maintenance for four weeks of a social media
        presence on a site/service new to the student (for FERPA purposes, aliases are allowed).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Writing with Media</b> A digital writing project rich with images, sounds, and/or video,
        based on the content of another course in which the student is enrolled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach Your Teachers</b> A small-group writing project emphasizing collaboration and
        project management; each group will develop guidelines for a particular kind of digital
        writing, for an audience of faculty at IIT looking to build more sophisticated digital
        writing assignments into their courses.
      </li>
    </ul>
