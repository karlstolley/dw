    <h1>COM 201: Digital Writing</h1>
    <h2>
     A new spring 2015 course to be offered by
     <a href="https://twitter.com/karlstolley">@karlstolley</a> at IIT
    </h2>

  <div id="main">

    <h3>Look, Microsoft Word sucks.</h3>

    <p>
      And I’m sorry that you use it. I’m sorry that some courses and jobs require you to use it. I’d
      like for you to never have to use it again, if you’d prefer to use something else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe the best thing about widescreen laptops and tablets is that there is less of the blank,
      uninspiring wasteland of white page to look at when creating a new Word document.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that soul-crushing wasteland is still there, along with its cursor that, with every blink,
      reminds you just how many more pages you have yet to go. Bump up your font size to 13 points,
      maybe set the line spacing manually to 27 or 28 points, just slightly beyond double-spacing,
      to eek out a few more pages so you can be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do people do this to themselves? When it’s time to write, people open up Word, or maybe
      Google Docs. It’s basically the same thing. And it basically sucks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing shouldn’t suck. Writing actually <i>doesn’t</i> suck—but the engrained approaches and
      technologies that professors and bosses and students alike blindly employ very often <i>do</i>
      suck. I totally get why signing up for a class with “writing” in its title sounds like bad
      idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this class acknowledges a simple, overlooked fact: Humans are noisy, social creatures. We
      speak, we write. We draw and doodle and photograph. Under the best circumstances, we’re free
      to speak and write and communicate. Nobody has to threaten us to write, but nobody has to
      reward us, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compare the experience writing for classes to all of the other writing you do (and you do do a
      ton of writing outside of class—way more writing that you do inside class): Facebook comments,
      Instagram photos, Snapchats, Kik and WhatsApp and text messages. Tweets. Reblogs on Tumblr.
      Image macros. Rage comics. Snarky YouTube comments. Maybe Vine videos. (Yes, that’s all
      writing).
    </p>

    <p>
      The tools you love most and use most to write certainly don’t default to black Times New Roman
      on a white faux 8.5 x 11 page. That’s the same basic approach as a typewriter, and typewriters
      were invented in the nineteenth century. And yet I’m guessing you have more than a few
      assignments due right now that are going to be made exactly that way.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one sits around watching a deadline draw closer and closer while struggling to meet a
      page-length requirement on Medium or Twitter or WordPress or Vine. You type and go. With
      urgency. With purpose. Sometimes, it’s like the apps on your phone or tablet can’t open
      quickly enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tools are amazing. They work on your phone. They don’t require an expensive monthly
      subscription, like Microsoft or Adobe products do (or will, once you graduate). But it’s not
      just about the tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Digital writing moves away from uninspired paper-based formats like .docx and .pdf, things
      that are basically meant to be filed away and never looked at again, and towards formats and
      communities and networks that might actually provide an opportunity for your thoughts to
      interest an audience. (Seriously, when has anyone ever said, <i>You know, what I really want
      to do is go find some Word documents to read</i>?)
    </p>

    <p>
      In the formats that most interest and engage people, words compete for equal time with still
      and moving images, sounds, even animation. A phone is as viable of a writing instrument as a
      laptop or a workstation. Instead of letter grades and red-pen marks with useless comments like
      “Awk,” digital writers antipate notifications. It sounds silly, but it’s true. Likes. Reblogs,
      retweets. If we’re lucky, we might even start a conversation. That leads us to write even
      more. Longer. More thoughtfully. There is the possibility for real impact in the world, both
      positive—and certainly negative (we’ll get to that in this class as well).
    </p>

    <h4>The guiding questions in COM201: Digital Writing are:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
      How do we take power and experience of writing digitally, for real audiences, and think
      carefully about it and artfully practice it to reshape how students approach writing for their
      college experience and their careers beyond? and
      </li>
      <li>
      2) What does it look like to genuinely write together, to collaboratively and innovatively
      manage projects and get real work done—not through some lifeless document that nobody’s ever
      going to read, or through towering management structures and marching orders, but through
      ethical, thoughtful uses of tools and approaches that too many people (professors, bosses, and
      even students themselves) think of as just toys and entertainment?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you’ve read this far, you might be interested in some of the projects for the course (not a single one of which is intended to be completed in a word processor):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Digital Literacy Narrative</b> A personal digital essay about the student's development
        as a writer in digital environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Social Media Presence</b> Initiation and maintenance for four weeks of a social media
        presence on a site/service new to the student (for FERPA purposes, aliases are allowed).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Writing with Media</b> A digital writing project rich with images, sounds, and/or video,
        based on the content of another course in which the student is enrolled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teach Your Teachers</b> A small-group writing project emphasizing collaboration and
        project management; each group will develop guidelines for a particular kind of digital
        writing, for an audience of faculty at IIT looking to build more sophisticated digital
        writing assignments into their courses.
      </li>
    </ul>
